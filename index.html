        <p><em>Hi i'm Andrea and i can develop everything is possible and everything you can imagine. 
            My passion on computer and on technology is borned when i was a child, i was always a nerd. 
            During my growing i'm interested on programming languages (C++, Java, Python, Scala, Html, Css and so on) 
            and on technologies like <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> and <a href="https://ubidots.com/blog/iot-embedded-systems/">Iot embedded devices</a>. 
            The university give me the possibility to go deep on these arguments but i feel that isn't enough. 
            I want to learn as much possibile from books and work opportunities, because the knowledge never hasn't an end. 
            I believe that only the practice can give you the right point of view in order to resolve the problems.

        <h3>University Projects</h3>
        <p><em>I did some projects during the university years:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li><em><strong>Thesis on <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> Game like flappy bird: </strong>This is the theme of my thesis of my fisrt degree.
                I did a web game using the three.js library. The scope of the game is to fly across the asteroids with a space shuttle and 
                reach the best score that you can do, using spacebar to evade the asteroids.
            </em></li>
            <li><em><strong>Environment of a game level in <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-4-26-released">Unreal Engine 4.26</a>: </strong>This is a project for Human Computer Interaction
                course. I did the part relative to the environment of the level using a medieval ambientation.
